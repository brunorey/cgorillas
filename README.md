# cgorillas
A copy of microsoft's qbasic [gorillas.bas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorillas_(video_game)) written in C.

At the moment it only allows one shot, still not functional as it doesn't have turns or scores.

## Compilation

Requires `libgraph`.

Compile by running `g++ gorillas.c -o gorillas -lgraph;`

Then simply run `./gorillas`
